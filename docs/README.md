# The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)

The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a framework that allows researchers and hobbyists to develop AI agents for Atari 2600 games. It is built on top of the Atari 2600 emulator [Stella](https://github.com/stella-emu/stella) and separates the details of emulation from agent design.

For an overview of our goals for the ALE read [The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10819). If you use ALE in your research, we ask that you please [cite](./citing.md) the appropriate paper in reference to the environment.
